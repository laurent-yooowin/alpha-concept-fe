## Notes
1. All endpoints require JWT authentication via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
2. Activity logs endpoint should be restricted to super_admin role
3. Dashboard endpoints filter data by coordinator_id if user role is 'coordinator'
4. Dashboard endpoints show all data for admin and super_admin roles
5. Average processing time is calculated from report creation to validation time
