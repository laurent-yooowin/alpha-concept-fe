# Report Validation and Modification Feature

## Overview
Added report validation and modification functionality to the application, allowing users to modify, validate, and send reports that are not yet validated by an admin.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Report Entity (`backend/src/reports/report.entity.ts`)
- Added two new report statuses:
  - `VALIDATED = 'valide'` - Report has been validated by admin
  - `REJECTED = 'rejete'` - Report has been rejected by admin

#### Database Migration (`backend/src/migrations/1706000000000-InitialSchema.ts`)
- Updated the `status` ENUM in the `reports` table to include:
  - `'valide'` (validated)
  - `'rejete'` (rejected)

#### Report Service (`backend/src/reports/report.service.ts`)
- Updated `countByStatus()` method to include counts for validated and rejected reports

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Report Service (`services/reportService.ts`)
- Updated `ReportStatus` type to include `'valide'` and `'rejete'`
- Added `sendReportEmail()` method to send reports via email
- Added `validateReport()` method to mark a report as validated

#### Reports Screen (`app/(tabs)/rapports.tsx`)

##### New State Variables
- `showEditModal`: Controls the edit modal visibility
- `editedContent`: Stores the edited report content
- `isSaving`: Tracks saving state

##### New Functions
- `handleModifyReport()`: Opens the edit modal with current report content
- `handleSaveModifications()`: Saves modified report content to the database
- `handleValidateReport()`: Marks a report as validated
- `handleSendReport()`: Saves report as "sent" and opens email client with pre-filled content

##### New UI Components

**Report Detail Modal Actions** (visible when status is not 'valide'):
1. **Modifier Button** (Orange gradient)
   - Opens edit modal to modify report content

2. **Valider Button** (Green gradient)
   - Validates the report (changes status to 'valide')

3. **Envoyer Button** (Blue gradient)
   - Saves report with status 'envoye'
   - Opens default mail app with pre-filled:
     - Recipient: `admin@csps.fr`
     - Subject: `Rapport SPS: {report title}`
     - Body: Complete report information including title, mission, client, date, conformity percentage, and content

**Edit Report Modal**:
- Full-screen modal with orange gradient header
- Multi-line text input for editing report content
- Save button with loading indicator

##### New Styles
- `reportDetailActions`: Container for action buttons
- `actionButton`: Individual action button wrapper
- `actionButtonGradient`: Gradient style for action buttons
- `actionButtonText`: Text style for action buttons
- `editModalContent`: Edit modal content container
- `editModalLabel`: Label for edit fields
- `editModalTextInput`: Multi-line text input for editing
- `saveButton`: Save button wrapper
- `saveButtonGradient`: Save button gradient style
- `saveButtonText`: Save button text style

### 3. Email Integration
- Uses `expo-linking` to open the default mail application
- Pre-fills email with:
  - Admin email address
  - Descriptive subject line
  - Complete report details in the body

## Validation Logic
Reports show the modification, validation, and send buttons only when:
- `selectedReport.originalStatus !== 'valide'`

This ensures that once a report is validated, these actions are no longer available.

## User Flow

1. **Modify Report**:
   - User opens report detail modal
   - Clicks "Modifier" button
   - Edit modal opens with current content
   - User edits content in text area
   - Clicks "Enregistrer" to save changes
   - Success message appears and reports list refreshes

2. **Validate Report**:
   - User opens report detail modal
   - Clicks "Valider" button
   - Report status changes to 'valide'
   - Success message appears and modal closes

3. **Send Report**:
   - User opens report detail modal
   - Clicks "Envoyer" button
   - Report status changes to 'envoye' and is saved
   - Default email app opens with pre-filled content
   - User can send the email directly from their mail app

## Notes
- All database operations use the existing report service API
- Error handling is implemented for all operations with user-friendly alerts
- The UI follows the existing design system with gradient buttons and modern styling
- Button visibility is conditional based on report validation status
