# Modal Position Fix for Mobile Devices

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** When opening modals (like "Programme a new mission" or mission details) on Samsung A55 and other mobile devices, the modals appeared at the bottom of the screen, making them hard to use. On web browsers, they worked fine.

**Expected Behavior:** Modals should appear centered on the screen on both mobile and web platforms.

## Solution

Changed modal positioning from **bottom-aligned** to **centered** with proper width constraints for all devices.

### Files Modified

1. `/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - New mission modal
2. `/app/(tabs)/missions.tsx` - Mission detail modal

## Changes Made

### Before (Bottom-Aligned - Problem on Mobile)

```typescript
modalOverlay: {
  flex: 1,
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)',
  justifyContent: 'flex-end',  // ❌ Pushes to bottom
},
newMissionModal: {
  maxHeight: '90%',
  borderTopLeftRadius: 24,      // Only rounded at top
  borderTopRightRadius: 24,
  overflow: 'hidden',
},
```

**Issue:**
- `justifyContent: 'flex-end'` pushes modal to bottom of screen
- On mobile phones (Samsung A55, etc.), this makes modal appear cut off or awkwardly positioned at the bottom
- User has to scroll or reach bottom of screen to interact

### After (Centered - Works on All Devices)

```typescript
modalOverlay: {
  flex: 1,
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)',
  justifyContent: 'center',     // ✅ Centers vertically
  alignItems: 'center',         // ✅ Centers horizontally
  paddingVertical: 20,          // ✅ Safe spacing from top/bottom
},
newMissionModal: {
  width: '95%',                 // ✅ Responsive width
  maxWidth: 600,                // ✅ Limits width on large screens
  maxHeight: '95%',             // ✅ Prevents overflow
  borderRadius: 24,             // ✅ All corners rounded
  overflow: 'hidden',
},
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Modal appears in center of screen
- ✅ Equal spacing from all edges
- ✅ Responsive width (95% of screen)
- ✅ Max width limit for large screens (600px)
- ✅ Safe padding prevents overlap with status bar/notches
- ✅ Works perfectly on all mobile devices
- ✅ Also looks great on web browsers
